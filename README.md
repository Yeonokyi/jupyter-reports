# Python Portfolio

## About
This repository showcases my programming skills in Python through various Jupyter Notebooks. As part of my Key Capabilities in Data Science Certificate from UBC Extended Learning, I gained hands-on experience in data analysis, visualization, and machine learning.

I completed Introduction to Machine Learning and Data Visualization as elective courses, which strengthened my ability to work with data-driven insights and predictive models.

## Notebooks
- Notebook 1: Data Analysis – Exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Pandas and altair.
- Notebook 2: Data Visualization – Creating insightful charts using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- Notebook 3: Machine Learning – Implementing classification and regression models with Scikit-learn.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Data Analysis – Cleaning, transforming, and analyzing datasets with Pandas.
- Data Visualization – Creating meaningful visualizations to interpret trends.
- Machine Learning – Building predictive models using Scikit-learn.
- Python Scripting – Automating data processing tasks.
