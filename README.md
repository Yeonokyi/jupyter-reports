About

This repository showcases my programming skills in Python through various Jupyter Notebooks. As part of my Key Capabilities in Data Science Certificate from UBC Extended Learning, I gained hands-on experience in data analysis, visualization, and machine learning.

I completed Introduction to Machine Learning and Data Visualization as elective courses, which strengthened my ability to work with data-driven insights and predictive models.

Notebooks

Notebook 1: Data Analysis – Exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Pandas and NumPy.

Notebook 2: Data Visualization – Creating insightful charts using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Notebook 3: Machine Learning – Implementing classification and regression models with Scikit-learn.

Skills Demonstrated

Data Analysis – Cleaning, transforming, and analyzing datasets with Pandas.

Data Visualization – Creating meaningful visualizations to interpret trends.

Machine Learning – Building predictive models using Scikit-learn.

Python Scripting – Automating data processing tasks.
